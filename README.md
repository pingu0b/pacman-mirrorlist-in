# pacman-mirrorlist-in
Fastest pacman mirrorlist in India according to my testing

Since Arch Linux repos in India have been facing severe downtimes recently I have compiled the best mirrors that work well in India

Just clone the repo and change your directory to it

'''console
git clone https://github.com/pingu0b/pacman-mirrorlist-in.git
cd pacman-mirrorlist-in/
'''
then run the '''mirrors-updater.sh''' script as root
'''console
chmod +x mirrors-updater.sh
sudo ./mirrors-updater.sh
'''
